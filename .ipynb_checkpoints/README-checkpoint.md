## Program function: 
The program first prompts the user for a name and age. After the user enters the 2 values, the program stores the inputs as variables. If the variable "age" entered by the user is greater than or equal to than 20, the program will greet and introduce the user to the course and the comment "You are so old." If the age is 20â€”1, the code will reply with the same greeting but the comment will be "You are young and energetic" instead. If the age is 0, the comment will be "I'm not sure how you are even interacting with this at such a young age...I'm impressed!". And finally, if the age is negative, the comment will be "You have a negative age and therefore have not been born yet, so I'm not exactly sure who I'm talking to right now"
