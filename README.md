# Lab
2-week lab project

Group Names: Eddie Lin (edl59@pitt.edu), Dominick Dellecave (dad210@pitt.edu)

Program function: The program first prompts the user for a name and age. After the user enters the 2 values, the program stores the inputs as variables. If the variable "age" entered by the user is greater than 20, the program will greet and introduce the user to the course and the comment "You are so old." If the age is 20 or below (including nagative years old), the code will reply with the same greeting but the comment will be "You are young and energetic" instead.
